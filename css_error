During translation of SCSS code, readed from the file '/Administration/Content/theme.scss', to CSS code syntax error has occurred. Error:
I had a such problem also.
In my project installed

LibSassHost 1.3.1
LibSassHost.Native.win-x64 1.3.1
BundleTransformer.SassAndScss 1.12.22
I tryied to add another one package LibSassHost.Native.win-x86, but after this I had another error

I noticed when I run the project iisexpress.exe runs from folder C:\Program Files (x86)\IIS Express.
Then I have changed one options in my VS2019
Tools -> Options -> Project and Solutions -> Web Projects and check the option
And check
Use the 64 bit version of IIS Express for web sites and projects
